    "- Use an audio-to-text transcriber and use NLP techniques to detect theme or sentiment.\n",
    "    - Find open source Python library for audio-to-text transcription.\n",
    "- Collect total number of subscibers for each publication if available.\n",
    "- Collect demographic data of Los Angeles to determine a rough estimate of adults with social media accounts or newpaper subscriptions.\n",

    "Ideas\n",
    "- Use demographic information to determine if the most vunerable Angelenos (Low-income) were affected more than affluent Angelenos.\n",
    "- Learn spatial statitics.\n",
