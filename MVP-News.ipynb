    "1. Determine if news stations and newspapers/articles effectively informed the public of continued parking enforcement on 10/15/2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If witness testimony is available, determine sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process\n",
    "- Check again to see if there are news reports that I may have missed.\n",
    "- Use an audio-to-text transcriber and use NLP techniques to detect theme or sentiment.\n",
    "    - Find open source Python library for audio-to-text transcription.\n",
    "- Collect total number of subscibers for each publication if available.\n",
    "- Collect demographic data of Los Angeles to determine a rough estimate of adults with social media accounts or newpaper subscriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideas\n",
    "- Use demographic information to determine if the most vunerable Angelenos (Low-income) were affected more than affluent Angelenos.\n",
    "- Learn spatial statitics.\n",
    "- Find Python library with spatial statistics."
